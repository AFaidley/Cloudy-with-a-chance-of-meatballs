# Cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs

## Description

I created a Weather App which shows users the current forecast for the city that the user enters as well as the 5 day forecast for the chosen city. It will also show the current UV Index and is color coded as per the Aim at Melanoma Foundation UV Index scale.

Here is a link to my deployed application:

## Usage

On entering my weather app, the user is presented with a 'Search City' input field in which they can type in the city of their choosing. Once they have typed in the selected city, they can press the search button and they will be presented with 'Today's Forecast' as well as the '5-day forecast' for their chosen city. They will also be given a color coded current UV index. The user will be able to see their recent searches and will be able to click on the search history cities and be presented with their weather information again, the user will also have the option of clearing their search history by clicking on the 'Clear Search' button.
Thank you for using my app!
